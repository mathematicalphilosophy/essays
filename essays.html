      <p>Throughout the history, people have tried not only to classify their political views and put themselves and others into
      suitable categories based on views, but also relate these categories amongst each other. However, most of the resulting
      models perform badly in describing the real state of affairs.</p>

      <p>We point out the flaws and attempt to find the cause of this bad performance. Afterwards, we suggest a better explanation
        and attempt to put forward a new model (or, more precisely, a class of models) which seem to perform better.</p></li>
